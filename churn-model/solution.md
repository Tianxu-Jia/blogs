Whether regression or classification, machine learning attempts to find the functional mapping relationship between input and output. Function mapping is essentially a kind of correlation, not causality. The aim of building churn model in business is to intervene and retain customers. Therefore, it is important to study causality and predict the consequences of intervention.

Causality and intervention is an ancient problem in long history. Countless sages spent their lives trying to find some causalities. Newton discovered the causal relationship between force and acceleration. Galileo proved that the falling speed of an object has nothing to do with the mass of it through the Leaning Tower experiment of Pisa. Unfortunately, until recently, the mathematical representation of causal reasoning and intervention was put forward, and from that the the set of strict mathematical theories and methods was developed.

To start our journy of real world churn model, We need to clarify some basic concepts
